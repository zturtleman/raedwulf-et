ilm's todo
- fix installation path of rpm/deb vs tgz2 (cpack)
- on-the-fly fullscreen switching: need glfwSetWindowMode for that
- remove sdl input and gimp code from repo
- add mumble rpc socket support
- cleanup warnings of missing sounds when loading (if possible)
- mouse jerkiness after ~10 min of play (possible openal related?)
